Bugs in version 0.2:

Problem with alpha-conversion and rigid names.

SPEC> bisim( x<z> | x(z), 0);
Error: logic variable on the left

Fixed by redefining get_freeids in input.ml.



Wishes for 0.3:

1. Free names treated as variables rather than constants.

2. Open progressing bisimulation checking.

3. Simulation checking.

4. Completed variants.
 -- Keyword 1 and predicate tick defined. Need to check correctness of extensions.
